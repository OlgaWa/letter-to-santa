## Introduction
**Letter to Santa** is a web app where you can write your own letter to Santa Claus, download it as a PDF file and see letters uploaded by others. It is a Django app with MySQL as a database. I've created the whole back-end of the app. Front-end is based on a template with my changes (credits below).
